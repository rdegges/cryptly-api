## cryptly-api

**An API service which makes crypto fun, easy, and safe!**


## Purpose

Crypto is hard, CPU intensive, slow, and notoriously easy to mess up.
[cryptly][] is meant to make this whole "crypto" thing simple and accessible for
everyone!

The entire project is open source (visit our [github repo][]) -- everything can
be easily audited for correctness -- want to get involved?  Do it!

My hope is that by being as open and transparent as possible, we can all make
the internet a little bit safer.
